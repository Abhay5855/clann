Rules

    Don't create a pull request on an issue that doesn't exist, create an issue first and if the changes you are proposing are said to be okay, you can go ahead and create a pull request

    Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged

    Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

    Do read the readme.md file

    Add the Issue you worked on in your Pull Request

    Fill out issue and pull request(PR) templates properly, if you don't know how, check out previous issues/PR to know how they are filled or this videoüëáüèæ
